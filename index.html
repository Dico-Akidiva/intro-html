Hello there, awesome person! come on in.
Data Management is the process of persisting and retrieving data.

Data Integration and Transformation, often referred to as Extract, Transform, and Load, or “ETL,” is the process of retrieving data from remote data management systems.

Data Visualization is part of an initial data exploration process, as well as being part of a final deliverable.

Model Building is the process of creating a machine learning or deep learning model using an appropriate algorithm with a lot of data.

Model deployment makes such a machine learning or deep learning model available to third-party applications.

Model monitoring and assessment ensures continuous performance quality checks on the deployed models.

Code asset management uses versioning and other collaborative features to facilitate teamwork.

Data asset management also supports replication, backup, and access right management.

Development environments, commonly known as Integrated Development Environments, or “IDEs”, are tools that help the data scientist to implement, execute, test, and deploy their work.

Execution environments are tools where data preprocessing, model training, and deployment take place.

Finally, there is fully integrated, visual tooling available that covers all the previous tooling components, either partially or completely.
